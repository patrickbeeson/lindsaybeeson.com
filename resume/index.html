		<ul>
		<li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
		<li>The Plum Baker has been a continual study in study — researching recipes, observing customer response, squeezing the most out of each hour of the week.

		<li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
		<li>I was hired to design calendar and column pages. In my first month with Metro Pulse, though, I identified ways to streamline the operation. At my request, I was charged with buttoning up processes and improving the archive system. I also stepped up as web manager when the switch to a new and more complicated site provided new opportunities and required more oversight.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li><h3>Roles</h3></li>
		<li>Designer, work-flow task master, website manager</li>

		<p>Roanoke, Va., June 2001 to March 2007</p>
		<ul>
		<li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
		<li>The paper not only allowed but encouraged me to experience everything from copy editing to writing to design. I also got my first taste of work-flow management when the newspaper switched design software (to Adobe) using a different platform (from Macs to PCs). I was on a small company-wide team whose mission was to learn the new system, construct a local work flow using that system and teach it to co-workers.</li>
